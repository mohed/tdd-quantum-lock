## About

This is an attempt at solving the padlock exercise. I took the liberty to use React as a framework and follow TDD methodology. I know that you guys use React in your products. Based on the discussion we had over the phone, you are also adopting a TDD-based approach. I hope that I haven't completely butchered the assignment.

## Instructions

Use `yarn` in a terminal from the project root to download all the dependencies. Alternatively, use `npm install` to achieve the same thing.

`yarn test` or `npm test` to run all the tests. These tests were the ones used to drive the development of the code. 

`yarn start` or `npm start` to start the service in a browser.

**Default passcode: 1234**

**Programming code: 9999**

## Known issues

- Multiple 0 entries in a row will cause some unintended behaviour
- The styling is not for the weakhearted. If at any point you feel dizzy, chest pain or general disgust, look away from the screen immediately.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
